# QUIZZZ

#### Just a simple quiz app where lecturer can create quiz and student can take quiz 👍

Won't be hosting the file for now. Netlify is cancelling hosting organizational repo for people on free tier, so guess there's no need to host 👌.

Also having a little problem with my liveserver or is it me 🤔, relative reference for files in same folder don't seems to work, like refrencing style.css from index.html using <link ... href="style.css"> does not work when hosted with my liveserver but works when hosted on netlify (as test, don't actually plan on hosting. should be deleted by now I believe), maybe it's me maybe my liveserver, man is not sure 🤷‍♂️.

The "TODO:" in the \*\*/\*.js are just reminders for me to remove the absolute path references in the js file and use relative just in case I decided to host.

I don't sincerely know why I'm using Github organization for this project but 🤷‍♂️.

Hope to come back to this later sha. Amen 😎.
